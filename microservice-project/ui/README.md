## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**

   - npm (Node Package Manager)

2. **Installation**
   Navigate to the `ui` directory and install the dependencies:

   npm install
   ```

3. **Running the Application**
   To start the development server, run:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Project Structure

- **public/**: Contains static assets such as HTML files, images, and icons.
- **src/**: Contains the source code for the React application.
  - **components/**: Contains reusable React components.
  - **App.js**: The main component that sets up the application structure and routing.
  - **index.js**: The entry point that renders the App component into the DOM.

## Build
